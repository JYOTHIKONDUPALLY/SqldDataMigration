    ACKNOWLEDGEMENT / CONSENT FORM – HORSE RIDING PARTICIPANTS
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    Kings Equestrian at Indus International School offers horseback riding programs for those interested
    in Casual riding, Dressage, Jumping and related workshops and clinics. Programs of this sort involve
    risk of personal injury, including, but not limited to, bruises, broken bones, head injuries and death.
    All normal safety precautions are taken to protect our participants, but occasionally accidents do happen.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    Horses may, without warning or apparent cause, buck, rear, stumble, fall, spook or make unanticipated
    movements, jump obstacles in their path, bite, kick, step on a person’s foot, or push or shove a person,
    and saddles or bridles may loosen or break, all of which may result in injury.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    We further note that if you are pregnant or immunocompromised you may be at a greater risk of injury
    and/or of contracting possible zoonotic agents due to your close proximity to animals and should consult
    your healthcare provider before undertaking equestrian activities.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    The school does not provide insurance to program participants. We strongly suggest that you should be
    covered under your own private insurance plan.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    All fees/funds will be used for animal welfare and well-being including feeding the horse, maintenance
    of the stable, and horse upkeep. Fees will not be refunded after enrolment.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    Kings Equestrian will not be responsible for any cancellations due to unpredicted weather, school leaves,
    school camps, student health, etc.

  <div class="section">
    Missed classes can only be accommodated in that particular week/weekend and will automatically lapse.

    Helmet, body protector, and shoes are mandatory for horse riding. Students and parents are responsible
